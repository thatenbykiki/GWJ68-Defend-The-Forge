You are Nero, the Obsidian Knight. Protector of the Grand Forge for thousands of years.

Your services have never been needed until now. A terrifying fungus has spread throughout your colony and all of your comrades are affected. They aim to destroy the forge and plunge the world into darkness. You must protect it, no matter the cost.
